# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open-minded and welcoming environment for all, where respectful and thoughtful communication is encouraged. We will not tolerate toxicity, rudeness, or harassment of any form.

## Our Standards

We encourage the following behaviors to maintain a positive and collaborative environment:

- **Respectful Communication:** Engage in thoughtful, respectful discussions. Disagreeing is fine, but do so without disrespect or rudeness.
- **Open-mindedness:** Be open to new ideas and experiences, especially when they differ from your own.
- **Constructive Criticism:** Share feedback in a helpful, constructive manner that benefits the project and the community.
- **Empathy and Kindness:** Show understanding and support for fellow contributors. Everyone's perspective and effort is valuable.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Toxicity and Rudeness:** Insulting, belittling, or mocking others.
- **Harassment:** Personal attacks, unwelcome comments, or any form of harassment.
- **Unconstructive Criticism:** Criticism that is not aimed at improving the project or helping others.
- **Ignoring the Project's Purpose:** Disregarding the values and purpose of the project in your contributions.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Contributing to the Project

To contribute to this project, we ask that you first **take time to understand the project**. Familiarize yourself with the README, the project's goals, and current direction. We also encourage you to **reach out to us** if you have questions or suggestions before making contributions. Communication is key to ensuring we are all on the same page and working toward a shared goal.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
